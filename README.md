# ❌ Denied. – Game Demo Showcase

Welcome to the showcase repository for **Denied.**, a fantasy immigration officer simulator set in a grim, Eastern Europe-inspired world.

This repo is dedicated to **highlighted code samples**, **development screenshots**, and an evolving **changelog**.  
⚠️ **No actual game files or full builds are included.** This is a concept/devlog space to document and share the core ideas and progress.

## 🌍 About the Game

**Denied.** puts you in the role of a border officer in a fictional bureaucratic regime.  
Inspired by *Papers, Please*, the game takes it further with **AI-powered NPC interactions** and **dynamic document editing**.

### 🧠 Key Features & Concepts

- **AI-Driven Interrogation**  
  NPCs generate varied, personality-driven responses using AI models—no two interviews are the same.

- **Document Design System**  
  Players must **create and edit documents manually**, adjusting stamps, seals, and formats to meet daily requirements.

- **Narrative Depth in a Fantasy World**  
  Set in a world of faded glory, nationalism, and creeping totalitarianism, where the line between truth and protocol blurs.
